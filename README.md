## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

> Add at least 2 questions new developers would ask when they decide to use your project.

- **How can I deploy this Portfolio project to a web server and make it accessible to others?**

  - To deploy the Portfolio project to a web server, you have several options. One common approach is to use a hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting. These services provide easy-to-use deployment options for static websites like portfolios. Typically, you'll need to push your project to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub) and then configure the hosting service to deploy the site automatically whenever you push changes. Each hosting service has its own documentation and guides on how to set up the deployment for static sites.

- **How can I customize the content and appearance of the Portfolio project to make it my own?**

- Customizing the content and appearance of the Portfolio project involves modifying the existing code and adding your own content. Here are some steps you can take to customize the project:

- Change Content: Update the ContactInfo component in Contact.js to display your own name, location, and email address. Also, update the description and other relevant details in the PageHeader component to reflect your own profile.

- Add Projects: If you want to showcase your projects, you can create a new component to display project cards or images, and then add this component to the Home.js or Projects.js page. You can also update the navigation links in the Navbar.js component to link to the new page.

- Styling: To change the appearance, you can modify the CSS styles in the index.css file or create a separate CSS file and import it into the components where you need custom styling. You can update colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements to match your preferences.

- Adding Pages: If you want to add more pages (e.g., an About Me page or a Resume page), you can create new components for those pages and add them to the App.js file.
